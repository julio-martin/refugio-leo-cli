A mother (Maya) that had 4 puppies (Fito, Luna, Lisa and Vera) besides Hera and Negrito of a previous litter.<br><br>All the neighbors of the area were tired of them, so we had to take them to a residence and shelter houses.<br><br>We decided to fix a plot where we could have them there. Seeing that there was no comfortable place for the dogs, we threw the caution to the wind and built the cheniles, this and having water enabled made us a shelter :).<br><br>One of the godmothers while preparing everything, stop to pay for the residence so Lisa and Luna were the first tenants of el Refugio.<br><br>The Refugio continues with the selfless help of many friends and volunteers, and not from the authorities, which hinders the work of our Refuge.<br><br>Many thanks to all those people who put their two cents to give a better life to all our dogs."
